1. Customer:

a. CustomerId (primary key, i nt, not null)
b. Name (varchar(50))

Table Name: tblCustomer

CREATE TABLE tblCustomer
(
	CustomerId int Constraint PK_tblCustomer_CustomerId
)

Queries do not need to be executed. You can use a simple text editor.
● all the customers whose name begins with "Joe"
● all the product names ordered by customer "Joe" after ' 11/1/2016'
● the total amount spend by customer "Joe"
● all the customer names and count of their orders for orders containing more than one
product

Queriers:
========
● all the customers whose name begins with "Joe"

select * from tblCustomer WHERE Name like 'Joe%';

● all the product names ordered by customer "Joe" after ' 11/1/2016'

SELECT Name FROM tblCustomer TC
inner 
join tblOrder TO on TO.CustomerId = TC.CustomerId
inner 
join OrderProduct TOP on TOP.OrderId = TO.OrderId
inner 
join  tblProduct TP on TP.ProductId = TOP.OrderProductId
Where TO.CreatedAt >'11/1/2016'
Order BY TP.Name


* the total amount spend by customer "Joe"

  SELECT SUM(TC.Price) 
  FROM tblOrder TO 
  inner 
  join tblCustomer TC ON TC.CustomerId = TO.CustomerId
  WHERE TC.Name = 'Joe'
	
  ● all the customer names and count of their orders for orders containing more than one
    product

     SELECT TC.Name,Count(TO.OrderId) from tblCustomer TC
     INNER
     JOIN tblOrder TO on TO.CustomerId = TC.CustomerId
     INNER JOIN
     tblOrderProduct TOP on TOP.OrderProductId = TO.OrderId
     Where TOP.OrderProductId>2 -- bit to be modify here
     Group By TC.Name,TO.OrderId


Part I - Logical skills:
==========================

1) Write a program that l oops through [1..100]. It should do the following:
a) If the number i s divisible by 3, print “fizz”.
b) If divisible by 5 print “buzz”.
c) If divisible by 3 & 5, print “fizzbuzz”.
2) Write a program to reverse a string “abcdef” --> “fedcba” without using the .NET
reverse() function
Prompt for the i nput from console and display the output to the console.

  
     
     
     

2. Product:
a. ProductId (primary key, i nt,on  not null)
b. Name (varchar(100))
c. Price (decimal(12, 2))

3. Order
a. OrderId (primary key, i nt, not null)
b. CustomerId (foreign key, i nt, not null)
c. CreatedAt (datetime, not null)

4. OrderProduct
a. OrderProductId (primary key, i nt, not null)
b. OrderId (foreign key, i nt, not null)
c. ProductId (foreign key, i nt, not null)
